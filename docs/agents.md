# Supported Agents

> [!NOTE]
> These docs track `main`, which may include unreleased changes. For the latest release, see the [v4.0.0 docs](https://github.com/Gentleman-Programming/gentle-ai/tree/v4.0.0/docs).

← [Back to README](../README.md)

Gentle AI configures agents you already have; it does not install an AI agent for you. ODD is the development workflow. Capabilities and delegation primitives depend on the client. [Usage](usage.md) covers installation and sync; [Pi](pi.md) explains the separately owned Pi integration.

## Agent guidance and ownership

Gentle AI installs or refreshes managed guidance, skills, and supported review agents for selected clients. It does not own Pi's runtime prompts or child-agent lifecycle: the separately installed Gentle Shell (`gentle-pi`) package does. Installing a single agent merges it into the recorded installed-agent selection; sync normally refreshes only that selection. `gentle-ai install --scope=workspace` places supported agent-scoped files in the project instead of the global agent configuration, while global-only settings remain global.

Delegated work stays focused: the parent supplies task context and exact relevant skill paths, then checks the outcome. A client without native delegation can perform smaller work inline; native availability does not grant permission for extra writes. Hermes workers require explicit mission context, tools and skills rather than assuming inheritance. Codex multi-agent execution depends on native tools and configuration. Review agents are separate from ordinary ODD implementation agents; RDD runs only under the user-owned switch and candidate consent when applicable.

## Client-specific details

- **Claude Code:** native Task subagents, skill-registry startup hook, and managed review/telemetry hooks. Review authority remains native, not a hook-generated approval.
- **OpenCode:** model discovery uses the active project's providers and tools. Optional background jobs are process-local and non-durable; do not use them for dependent work or parallel writers in one worktree. Managed launchers respect explicit background-off preferences; other launch paths use foreground fallback. See [OpenCode background subagents](opencode-profiles.md).
- **Kilo Code:** uses an OpenCode-compatible adapter; do not assume OpenCode runtime-specific guarantees automatically apply to Kilo.
- **Kimi Code:** the system prompt hub includes its persona/output-style modules (`KIMI.md` for the legacy layout, `AGENTS.md` for the current layout); no Claude-style `settings.json` output-style mechanism is assumed. Config paths prefer the current kimi-code v0.11+ root `~/.kimi-code` when it exists as a directory and fall back to the legacy `~/.kimi` root; a plain file named `.kimi-code` is not treated as the current layout, and unexpected stat failures on the current root are surfaced instead of silently selecting the legacy root. Current-layout skills install to `~/.kimi-code/skills`; legacy installs keep the shared `~/.config/agents/skills` path. YAML agents (only discoverable by the legacy CLI via `--agent-file`) always install to the legacy `~/.kimi/agents` directory, so the current layout never receives agent files it cannot load.
- **OpenClaw:** reads the active workspace from its configuration and writes managed `AGENTS.md`/`SOUL.md` there. MCP entries remain in global OpenClaw configuration.
- **Hermes:** detected from its configuration directory; installation of the client itself is manual. Existing top-level configuration is preserved when MCP entries are merged.
- **Conductor:** detected from the `~/.conductor` directory; installation of the desktop app itself is manual. Conductor workspaces inherit Claude Code configuration, so Gentle AI makes no Conductor-specific writes: it does not install skills, MCP servers, or system prompt files for Conductor — configure those through Claude Code instead.
- **Pi:** the installer provisions companion packages, but Gentle Shell owns runtime prompts, model assignments, persona, and delegation. See [Pi integration](pi.md).

Model assignment is client-specific and applies to supported generic and review roles, not a formal development-phase matrix. Use the TUI **Configure Models** screen to inspect available roles, including Judgment Day review roles. Strict TDD is an independently configured ODD mode, not inferred from the presence of tests. Run `gentle-ai doctor` for read-only installation diagnostics and `gentle-ai sync --dry-run` to preview managed updates. Uninstall previews and backs up managed configuration; it must preserve unrelated user files. [Full CLI guidance](usage.md#cli-commands).
