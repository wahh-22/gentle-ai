← [Back to README](../README.md)

`gentle-ai.review-integration/v2` coordinates one immutable review transaction at a time. Go owns the candidate snapshot, review admission, correction boundary, terminal burn, and all provider-facing bindings. Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, and Pi transport provider-issued work; no runtime adapter decides review or delivery.

## RDD defaults to ON

RDD is on by default and opt-out. With no configured preference, status reports `effective: on, source: default` without saving a user decision. Explicit global or clone-local OFF wins; use `gentle-ai review mode disable` to opt out. Automation must not toggle the mode or persist a preference on the user's behalf. Candidate consent is separate, and delivery always follows ordinary repository policy. Enabling revalidates the current candidate; it never resumes stale authority.

## Quick path

The orchestrator enters this lifecycle once per candidate, after an authorized implementation is complete and normalized and before reporting it complete, whenever the switch reads enabled; it does not wait for the user to ask for a review.

1. Preflight only the current worktree with selectorless negotiated STATUS.
2. Execute its exact START, then retain the returned lineage, revision, and target tokens.
3. Use those exact tokens for every STATUS and capture call; after approval, run only the exact acknowledgement transition STATUS or the terminal response owns.
4. Follow ordinary repository policy for commit, push, PR, release, and archive.

```bash
gentle-ai review status \
  --cwd <repo> \
  --contract gentle-ai.review-integration/v2 \
  --agent claude-code \
  --next-transition
```

Claude Code also gets a deterministic per-session baseline and end-of-turn reminder through its installed `SessionStart` and `Stop` hooks, both backed by the review stop-hook subcommand: SessionStart records the session's starting candidate, and Stop reminds only about candidates that session itself produced; neither starts a review by itself.

## Cross-repository root

A session in repository A may review a nested target in unrelated repository B only after the user explicitly authorizes B. Native Go resolves the requested path to B's canonical worktree root; adapters carry opaque provider output and never parse authorization or roots.

| Rule | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| Lifecycle root | After B is selected, the host keeps canonical B from STATUS through consent, collection, correction, targeted validation, and burn. A is never a fallback. |
| Commands | Run provider-issued tokens unchanged. If a command omits `--cwd`, run it with process cwd B. |
| Opaque capture | `repository_context` can materialize or capture from another process cwd, but remains B-bound. |
| Isolation | Equal lineage text in A and B names independent transactions. Approval burns B only; A remains untouched. |
| Delivery | Ordinary repository policy and any explicit delivery authorization name B. Approval never authorizes delivery. |

This lifecycle is available only to Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, and Pi. Unsupported runtimes fail before repository or authority mutation.

## Atomic lifecycle

### 1. Selectorless STATUS preflights only

Selectorless STATUS evaluates only the current worktree candidate and renders one exact START invocation. It does **not** discover ambient authority, resume another worktree, recover history, or select a stale lineage. The parent runs only the returned `next_transition` and its ordered tokens.

### 2. START freezes an independent transaction

START freezes the candidate in one compact transaction, explicitly bound to its lineage, worktree, and target. It selects risk and lenses natively. Capture the returned lineage, revision, and target tokens.

An exact replay of an active START can return `replayed`. A genuinely new START is independent. Do not reuse a burned lineage.

### 3. Bound calls drive the transaction

A reviewing START carries `next_transition.execute(review.status)` — the provider-issued re-entry for its frozen binding. The parent runs that command verbatim, with the repository as process cwd, and satisfies every later STATUS and bound capture call only with the exact tokens each returned transition names. The parent routes only from that transaction's returned `next_transition`:

| Transition | Parent action |
| --- | --- |
| `execute` | Run the exact operation and ordered arguments unchanged. |
| `collect` | Provide only its named input through its exact capture operation, then query bound STATUS again. |
| `stop` | Run no lifecycle operation. Do not infer a recovery from prose. |

A forecast is descriptive, not a route. Relay every forecast step and horizon losslessly, but execute only `next_transition`.

#### Native recovery for an explicitly selected lineage

When native STATUS selects legal, representable recovery, its returned
`review.recover` invocation carries four core arguments: predecessor lineage,
exact predecessor revision, successor lineage, and disposition. Replay every
returned target selector unchanged, including declared untracked scope and its
inventory digest. Native RECOVER derives actor, reason, and the exact audit
binding; consumers must not manufacture an external authorization collection.
This does not supply missing runtime consent or authorize delivery.

STATUS preserves an explicit `--recovery-successor-lineage`; otherwise it derives
one name from the existing worktree-and-target identity. It never searches for
an available suffix. An occupied name, the predecessor's own name, or an already
recorded successor fails closed with a read-only `review inspect-authority`
diagnostic. Run that diagnostic with the requested repository as process cwd;
do not invent a new successor to bypass the conflict.

Explicit compatibility remains available through the complete successor,
`--recovery-actor`, `--recovery-reason`, and `--recovery-authorization` binding.
STATUS renders the existing seven-argument RECOVER form only for an exact binding.
Explicit empty/wrong authorization or a partial tuple refuses without mutation;
it never falls back to self-derivation. Core recovery legality remains unchanged,
including failed-criteria and accounting-only evidence checks.

### 4. Approved authority awaits acknowledgement, then burns

Native Go owns frozen lenses, provider context and admission, refutation, one bounded correction, repository evidence, and targeted validation. A successful final capture or zero-lens START first records `approved` with one exact acknowledgement transition. The terminal closure and approved authority remain replayable until that acknowledgement succeeds.

| Moment | Consumer action | Native behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Approval response | Retain the provider-owned acknowledgement operation, ordered arguments, binding, and token exactly as returned. | START or the terminal closure returns `approved` without burning the authority. |
| Retry before acknowledgement | Re-query bound STATUS; do not reconstruct or substitute an acknowledgement. | STATUS reoffers the same exact acknowledgement transition while the approved authority remains current. |
| Wrong, stale, or mismatched acknowledgement | Treat the error as non-mutating, retain the original binding, then re-query bound STATUS. | Validation fails before mutation; the authority and pending acknowledgement remain replayable. |
| Exact acknowledgement | Run the returned command once. If its outcome is uncertain, re-query bound STATUS instead of guessing or replaying an invented command. | Under the existing lock, Go validates the complete binding and token, then burns the exact lineage and artifacts. |

The acknowledgement transition is an execution detail of `gentle-ai.review-integration/v2`; it does not authorize delivery. Escalated and other non-approved terminal paths retain their existing response and STATUS behavior and do not gain an acknowledgement transition. After a malformed, incomplete, or unavailable capture, retain the exact lineage, revision, and target binding, query bound STATUS once, and follow only the reoffered capture route.

After a successful burn, no terminal receipt, tombstone, witness, mirror, or delivery authority survives. Other lineages and worktrees are unaffected.

## Reviewer transport

The provider contract is shared by Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex, and Pi. Go derives frozen trees, manifest, subject hash, role, binding, schema, evidence limits, and admission. Adapters transport opaque provider output and never parse bindings, manufacture a verdict, or mutate review authority. Gentle AI writes nothing into the Pi system prompt because gentle-pi owns it, so this contract ships as `orchestration/pi.md` in the published provider contract bundle, which gentle-pi mirrors and injects at session start.

Each provider-issued capture input is one slot. Its reviewer prompt starts with `GENTLE_AI_REVIEW_BINDING ` followed by one-line binding JSON. A result echoes the exact `subject_hash`, reports completed inspection of the full manifest, and supplies structured findings/evidence. On malformed, incomplete, or unavailable inspection, query bound STATUS again; relaunch only when it reoffers the exact same slot.

Reviewers inspect only provider-bound immutable trees. They never inspect the live worktree, index, `HEAD`, or another revision, and candidate bytes must not move through `/tmp`, a repository scratch file, or `GENTLE_AI_FROZEN_CANDIDATE_CONTEXT`.

### Non-lens provider roles: refuter and targeted validator

`gentle-ai review capture-refuter` and `gentle-ai review capture-validation` bind the transaction-wide refuter batch and the correction-bound targeted validator the same way `review capture-result` binds a lens — `--lineage`, `--target`, `--expected-revision` (plus `--request-hash` for the validator) — and exactly one of three modes. A compiled runtime (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode) passes `--agent` and `--execute`: Go materializes the role request, runs its own in-process adapter, and admits the raw result; no submission descriptor exists for this form, and `--materialize`/`--input` refuse typed for it. Pi is host-relay, so `--execute` refuses typed for it: Go never spawns a process for a pi role. STATUS instead renders the pi collect input as `--materialize=true` plus a `submission` descriptor, exactly like the lens `capture-result` path — `gentle-pi` materializes the read-only prompt, runs the model itself, and submits the raw result through `--input=<path|->`, whose `{{value}}` slot repeats every binding token (including `--agent`) and drops only the `--materialize` selector. Go admits that submission through the same raw admitters the compiled `--execute` path uses, with the same binding; no adapter runs and no retry is granted, so an unadmittable submission leaves the slot open for STATUS to reoffer, exactly like a malformed in-process capture.

The role submission descriptor is a negotiated status contract change, so the negotiated status schema for this lifecycle is `gentle-ai.review-integration.status/v9` (v5 forbade a `submission` field on role inputs). Go no longer owns a pi adapter or the `~/.pi/gentle-ai/models.json` model-routing lookup it used to read before spawning a role process for pi; `gentle-pi`'s own host relay owns that routing now, the same way it already owns routing for the lens path.

## Corrections and consent

Native Go alone selects lenses, classifies candidate causality, performs refutation, derives repository evidence, and permits at most one bounded correction. A validator that cannot inspect its immutable trees has no verdict; report that block rather than submitting a failed validation.

Medium and high-risk START may return the typed `gentle-ai.review-integration.consent/v3` envelope. Relay the complete choice envelope losslessly, preserve machine tokens and invocations exactly, and run only the invocation selected by the human. Global RDD mode permits review; it never grants per-candidate consent. A decline is not the kill switch.

## Read-only risk assessment (`gentle-ai review assess`)

`gentle-ai review assess --cwd <repo> [--agent <runtime>] [--base-ref <ref> --committed-only] [--untracked-scope exclude|select --intended-untracked <path> --expected-untracked-inventory <digest>] [--json]` prints the same candidate risk classification START uses to select lenses (`reviewtransaction.AssessSnapshotRisk`), without creating any review authority, lineage, or store mutation. It works identically with receipt-driven development on or off, so a host can gate delegated verification on the result before ever calling `review start`.

It builds the exact same candidate `review start` would: current changes by default, or an immutable base-to-HEAD comparison with `--base-ref` (which requires `--committed-only` to acknowledge dirty tracked changes, exactly like `review start`). The untracked-scope flags accept the same values `review start` does. The optional `--agent` declares the runtime identity to carry on `next_transition` below; it is validated exactly as `review status --agent` is.

With `--json`, it prints the typed `gentle-ai.review-assessment/v1` envelope:

```json
{
  "schema": "gentle-ai.review-assessment/v1",
  "risk": "medium",
  "reasons": [{"code": "executable_change", "path": "notes/scratch.txt"}],
  "changed_paths": 1,
  "changed_lines": 430,
  "candidate": {"kind": "base-diff", "base_ref": "15ea98ed", "consumed": false},
  "review_due": true,
  "review_due_reason": "slice_budget_reached",
  "next_transition": {
    "operation": "review.status",
    "command": "gentle-ai review status --cwd <repo> --contract gentle-ai.review-integration/v2 --agent claude-code --next-transition --base-ref 15ea98ed --committed-only",
    "arguments": [
      {"name": "cwd", "value": "<repo>"},
      {"name": "contract", "value": "gentle-ai.review-integration/v2"},
      {"name": "agent", "value": "claude-code"},
      {"name": "next-transition", "value": "true"},
      {"name": "base-ref", "value": "15ea98ed"},
      {"name": "committed-only", "value": "true"}
    ]
  }
}
```

`risk` is `passive`, `medium`, or `high`. `passive` is exactly the tier START selects zero reviewer lenses for (every authored path proven passive documentation by its own frozen bytes); `medium` and `high` keep the same vocabulary and evidence codes START's own `risk_reasons` already publishes, so this projection can never disagree with the classification a review of the same candidate would use.

`candidate.consumed` reports whether this exact candidate identity's terminal review authority was already acknowledged (`reviewtransaction.CompactTargetConsumed`, the same evidence `review status` itself consults before ever offering a fresh START for the identical identity), so a caller never re-derives that from a tombstone.

`review_due` and `review_due_reason` turn the tier into the one consequence an orchestrator needs, in evaluation order: a consumed candidate always reports `already_reviewed` (`review_due: false`) regardless of tier; `high` risk always reports `review_due: true` with `high_risk`; `medium` reports `review_due: true` with `slice_budget_reached` once `changed_lines` reaches `reviewtransaction.LargeChangeLines` (400) over the assessed range, else `review_due: false` with `under_budget`; `passive` always reports `review_due: false` with `passive`. `changed_lines` is whatever range the caller assessed — pass `--base-ref <last reviewed boundary> --committed-only` to make it the accumulated ODD slice.

`next_transition` is present only when `review_due` is `true`: it is the exact, literally runnable `review status ... --next-transition` preflight continuation, built with the same argument builders and conventions `review status` itself uses, so an orchestrator executes `next_transition.command` verbatim instead of reconstructing the invocation from prose. Argument order is fixed: `--cwd`, `--contract`, the optional `--agent` the caller declared, `--next-transition`, and — only for a named base comparison — the caller's own `--base-ref` echoed verbatim plus `--committed-only`.

Without `--json`, it prints the same information as human-readable text, including a `review due: yes/no (<reason>) -> <command>` line.

When the candidate cannot be built or classified (for example an unresolvable `--base-ref`), the command fails closed and names a runnable continuation of the same command with a resolvable `--base-ref`. A host that cannot resolve the named continuation should treat the failure exactly as it would treat a `"high"` result.

## Delivery remains human-owned

`gentle-ai review validate` and named gates (`post-apply`, `pre-commit`, `pre-push`, `pre-pr`, and `release`) are compatibility/informational commands. They never discover authority or decide delivery:

| Mode | Informational result |
| --- | --- |
| RDD enabled | `invalidated/unmanaged` |
| RDD disabled | `disabled/unmanaged` |

They never allow, approve, block, commit, push, or open a pull request. Delivery follows ordinary repository policy.

Terminal review state is informational and never authorizes a commit. Commit, push, PR, release, and archive follow ordinary repository policy and require their own explicit authorization. For a selected repository B, any authorized delivery action runs in B only.

## Compatibility

The v1 contract and historical artifacts remain published compatibility surfaces. They may be inspected with explicit, manual compatibility operations, but they are not an ordinary v2 lifecycle, cannot resurrect a burned transaction, and do not authorize delivery.

### Continue after a stop reason code

A `stop` carries one reason code and no executable transition. The table below is the complete continuation inventory for the atomic target-root lifecycle. `Terminal` means no in-lineage continuation exists; it never authorizes delivery. For every clone-scoped exit, gates remain unmanaged and ordinary repository policy decides delivery.

| Reason code | Continuation |
| --- | --- |
| `captured_artifacts_unverifiable` | Terminal — a captured reviewer artifact failed local verification. Ask a maintainer to inspect the B authority, or run `gentle-ai review mode disable --scope clone --cwd <repo>`. |
| `captured_result_selection_unavailable` | Terminal — an internal result-selection invariant failed. Ask a maintainer to inspect the lineage, or run `gentle-ai review mode disable --scope clone --cwd <repo>`. |
| `corrected_candidate_unavailable` | Change the correction candidate in B, then re-query `gentle-ai review status --cwd <repo> --contract gentle-ai.review-integration/v2 --agent {{GENTLE_AI_RUNTIME_AGENT_ID}} --next-transition` with the captured lineage and target. Do not reuse the pre-correction target. |
| `empty_base_diff_bootstrap_required` | Terminal — the committed base has no reviewable paths. Use the separately authorized empty-root bootstrap for a new target, or run `gentle-ai review mode disable --scope clone --cwd <repo>`. |
| `lens_context_budget_exceeded` | Terminal — immutable reviewer context cannot be truncated. Reduce the B candidate scope and start a new transaction, or run `gentle-ai review mode disable --scope clone --cwd <repo>`. |
| `correction_context_budget_exceeded` | Release this review authority: the corrected candidate's evidence plus its recorded findings cannot fit the runtime context budget, so no targeted validation can ever be assembled and `gentle-ai review invalidate` refuses once lens results are admitted. Run `gentle-ai review abandon --cwd <repo> --lineage <id> --expected-revision <revision> --reason operator_disposition --actor <actor> --maintainer-authorization <binding>` (run `gentle-ai review abandon` with no flags to print the binding template). The STATUS stop carries that release as `next_transition.continuation` with `operation: "abandon"` whenever the authority is eligible, and omits it entirely when it is not, rather than naming a command the live operation would refuse. Then review the change as smaller candidates, or run `gentle-ai review mode disable --scope clone --cwd <repo>`. |
| `managed_assets_outdated` | Run the exact sync command named in the stop's `continuation` field (anchored to the executable that reported the stale assets, so it cannot resolve to a different `gentle-ai` on `PATH`, and bound to the runtime agent STATUS was asked for), then re-query the exact repository-bound STATUS command; the same candidate is offered again once the recorded digest converges. The quoted Windows form is cmd.exe command syntax; PowerShell requires the call operator (`& "..." sync ...`). |
| `corrupted_or_unverifiable_authority` | Terminal — the authority is unreadable or unsupported. Ask a maintainer to inspect it, or run `gentle-ai review mode disable --scope clone --cwd <repo>`. |
| `manual_intervention_required` | Terminal — the authority state is outside the negotiated lifecycle. Ask a maintainer to inspect it, or run `gentle-ai review mode disable --scope clone --cwd <repo>`. |
| `missing_authority_binding` | Terminal — a current target had no authority binding. File a bounded defect with the lineage, or run `gentle-ai review mode disable --scope clone --cwd <repo>`. |
| `native_stop_required` | Terminal — the lineage is escalated but has no native continuation. Ask a maintainer to inspect it, or run `gentle-ai review mode disable --scope clone --cwd <repo>`. |
| `recovery_scope_unchanged` | Change B so its target identity differs, then retry the exact returned `gentle-ai review recover` invocation. |
| `staged_workspace_overlay_recovery_unavailable` | Terminal — pass `--lineage <id>` to recover an existing lineage, or drop `--workspace-overlay` and start a fresh target; otherwise run `gentle-ai review mode disable --scope clone --cwd <repo>`. |
| `unachievable_lens_slot` | A host reported a selected reviewer slot unachievable under current conditions. If that was transient, re-run `gentle-ai review capture-unachievable` with the same binding and `--withdraw=true` so B re-offers the same slot. If it is not transient, reduce the B candidate scope and start a new `gentle-ai review start`, or run `gentle-ai review mode disable --scope clone --cwd <repo>`. |
| `target_already_acknowledged` | Terminal: this exact target was already acknowledged and its review authority burned. No further review action is required; delivery follows ordinary repository policy. Changed targets remain eligible for review. Only when deliberately requesting a new independent review, use `gentle-ai review start`; do not automatically restart this consumed target. |
| `rdd_disabled` | Run the exact source-scoped `gentle-ai review mode enable` command rendered by STATUS, then re-run its exact repository-bound STATUS command. |

## Published v1 compatibility reference

The published v1 directory contains 23 strict JSON Schemas and 24 deterministic conformance fixtures. These are read-only compatibility inventory, not durable v2 receipt, gate-allow, or mirror state.

- `legacy_v1_read_only` failures retain `mutation_outcome` values `not_started`, `unknown`, and `committed`; Legacy-v1 never reports `publication_pending`, with retry and replay disabled where its historical operation requires a new compact lineage.
- Historical `ordinary_4r` legacy status omits `frozen`. START, BIND-SDD, invalidation, and direct append are compatibility names only and never re-enter the atomic lifecycle.
- Published vocabulary remains readable: `native_frozen_candidate_context`, `base_tree`, `candidate_tree`, `changed_path_manifest`, `opaque_repository_context`, `provider_targeted_validation_request`, `provider_artifact_admission`, `validating_result_reopen`, and `recovered_correction_evidence`.
- Artifact compatibility names remain `artifact_subjects`, `subject_hash`, and `admission_decision: completed`; low-risk compatibility names remain `native_low_risk_verification`, `selected_lenses: []`, and `receipt_scope_changed`. They describe historical data only and do not restore a receipt after an atomic approval burn.
- Operational bounds remain a 25-second aggregate budget, 120-second budget, 180-second budget, and one-second wait delay. Persistent compact `LOCK` JSON is advisory diagnostics. `context.scope_change` and `review.recover` are explicit compatibility/recovery vocabulary, not ambient lifecycle discovery.
