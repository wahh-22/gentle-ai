# Quickstart

## Prerequisites

### macOS

- Homebrew installed and available in PATH.
- `git` available.
- If Homebrew requires tap trust, run `brew trust --formula gentleman-programming/tap/gentle-ai` once.

### Ubuntu/Debian (and derivatives like Linux Mint, Pop!\_OS)

- `apt-get` available (standard on these distros).
- `sudo` access for package installs.
- `git` available.
- If Node.js is missing, `gentle-ai install` prints this install hint: NodeSource LTS setup + `apt-get install -y nodejs` (npm comes bundled).
- If using Homebrew on Linux, Bubblewrap may require unprivileged user namespaces; see `docs/usage.md#homebrew-upgrade-troubleshooting`.

### Arch Linux (and derivatives like Manjaro, EndeavourOS)

- `pacman` available (standard on these distros).
- `sudo` access for package installs.
- `git` available.
- If Node.js is missing, `gentle-ai install` prints this install hint: `pacman -S --noconfirm nodejs npm`.

### Fedora / RHEL family (Fedora, CentOS Stream, Rocky Linux, AlmaLinux)

- `dnf` available (standard on these distros).
- `sudo` access for package installs.
- `git` available.
- If Node.js is missing, `gentle-ai install` prints this install hint: NodeSource LTS setup + `dnf install -y nodejs` (npm comes bundled).

### Android (Termux)

- `pkg` available (standard in Termux).
- No `sudo` required (Termux runs in user space).
- `git` available.

### All platforms

- Go 1.24+ (for building from source).
- Node.js 18+ and npm: `gentle-ai install` checks these as required prerequisites on every platform and prints a warning with a distro-specific install hint (see above) if either is missing — regardless of which agents/components you select. It does not install them for you. They are strictly required if you select any agent or component installed via `npm install -g` (most agent integrations, plus the CodeGraph community tool).
- Pi installed and available as `pi` on `PATH` if you select the Pi agent.

### Windows

- Go 1.25.10+, because Windows installs and upgrades through `go install`.
  Official Windows binaries and the Scoop bucket are temporarily unavailable
  while publicly trusted Authenticode signing is provisioned, so nothing
  unsigned is ever fetched. With Go on `PATH`, `gentle-ai upgrade` updates
  itself automatically by running `go install …/cmd/gentle-ai@vX.Y.Z` pinned to
  the release tag and verified against the Go checksum database; without Go it
  fails closed and just prints that command. See [platforms.md](platforms.md)
  and the
  [restoration gate](release-signing.md#windows-distribution-restoration-gate).

```powershell
# Latest released RDD build (v2 line)
go install github.com/gentleman-programming/gentle-ai/v2/cmd/gentle-ai@latest

# Stable, pre-RDD pin (v1 line)
go install github.com/gentleman-programming/gentle-ai/cmd/gentle-ai@v1.46.0
```

The two commands use different import paths on purpose. Go requires the `/vN`
suffix in the module path for major version 2 and above, so every `v2.x` release
is installed as `.../gentle-ai/v2/cmd/gentle-ai`. The `v1.46.0` pin predates that
rule and must keep the unsuffixed path; adding `/v2` to it would make Go refuse
the tag.

## Version Policy

Receipt-Driven Development (RDD) started in `gentle-ai` `v1.47.0` on 2026-07-10, when the first bounded native review transactions were added. Every release from `v1.47.0` onward is part of the unstable RDD development line. New releases will continue improving RDD until the project declares the line stable. The stable version for normal use without RDD is the immediately preceding release, `v1.46.0`.

Use `@latest` to install the latest released RDD build for testing. The negotiated public review contract was published in `v2.1.6`. Builds from `main` may contain changes after the latest release and are intended for unreleased RDD development testing.

### Import paths differ between the v1 and v2 lines

Go requires the module path of a major version 2 or higher to end in `/vN`.
Every `v2.x` install therefore uses `github.com/gentleman-programming/gentle-ai/v2/cmd/gentle-ai`,
and the pre-RDD `v1.46.0` pin keeps the unsuffixed
`github.com/gentleman-programming/gentle-ai/cmd/gentle-ai`. Each path resolves
only its own major line; swapping them makes Go refuse the version.

### Install the stable version

Use an exact Go module version to keep the baseline reproducible on macOS, Linux, or Windows:

```bash
go install github.com/gentleman-programming/gentle-ai/cmd/gentle-ai@v1.46.0
gentle-ai version
```

### Install the latest released RDD build for testing

```bash
go install github.com/gentleman-programming/gentle-ai/v2/cmd/gentle-ai@latest
gentle-ai version
```

### Install unreleased RDD changes

Only use `main` when testing changes that are not part of a release yet:

```bash
go install github.com/gentleman-programming/gentle-ai/v2/cmd/gentle-ai@main
gentle-ai version
```

The managed install scripts select the latest released version for the chosen channel and do not accept arbitrary release pins. Because every release from `v1.47.0` onward is currently unstable RDD, use the exact `go install ...@v1.46.0` command above when you need the stable version.

## Run

```bash
go run ./cmd/gentle-ai install --dry-run
```

Use `--dry-run` first to validate selections and execution plan without applying changes. The dry-run output includes a `Platform decision` line showing the detected OS, distro, package manager, and support status.

## First real install

```bash
go run ./cmd/gentle-ai install
```

The installer detects your platform automatically — no flags needed to select macOS vs Linux. Install commands are resolved through the appropriate package manager (brew, apt, pacman, dnf, or pkg) based on detection.

After completion, verify that agent configs and selected components were installed to their expected paths.

The agents you select during install become the default scope for future `gentle-ai sync` runs. Gentle AI records that selection in `~/.gentle-ai/state.json` and does not automatically sync every agent config directory that exists on your machine. To check what will be updated after an upgrade, run:

```bash
gentle-ai sync --dry-run
```

To update a different set explicitly, pass every target agent:

```bash
gentle-ai sync --agent claude-code --agent opencode
```

## Verification outcome

When checks pass, installer reports:

`You're ready. Run 'claude' or 'opencode' and start building.`

If something looks wrong after install, run `gentle-ai doctor` for a read-only health check. It verifies tool binaries, `state.json` validity, Engram MCP reachability, and disk space — each check reports pass/warn/fail with a remedy hint.

For a Pi-only install, the plan shows the Pi package stack instead of Gentle AI components. It installs `gentle-pi`, `gentle-engram`, and `pi-mcp-adapter`, runs `pi-engram init` through the pinned `gentle-engram` package, then installs `pi-subagents-j0k3r`, `@juicesharp/rpiv-ask-user-question`, `pi-web-access`, `@juicesharp/rpiv-todo`, and `pi-btw`.

## Hardening recommendations for users

Gentle AI pins versions and disables postinstall scripts on every npm install it generates. When you install the `permissions` component, a sensitive-paths deny list is applied to Claude Code and OpenCode blocking access to `~/.ssh/*`, `**/*.pem`, `**/*.key`, `**/.env*`, `~/.aws/credentials`, and other credential paths. See [Components](../docs/components.md) for the full list.

For broader protection across npm packages you install yourself, set these once on your machine:

- `npm config set ignore-scripts true` — blocks postinstall scripts globally; the primary supply-chain attack vector.
- `npm config set min-release-age 3` — skip packages published in the last 3 days; catches malicious typosquats before you install them.
- `npm config set allow-git none` — block git: dependencies, which can be moving targets.

Optional wrapper tools for extra defense:

- [`npq`](https://github.com/lirantal/npq) — audits a package against several heuristics before it installs.
- [`sfw`](https://socket.dev/) (Socket Firewall) — runtime guard that intercepts suspicious behavior at install/run time.

## Unsupported platforms

If you run the installer on an unsupported OS or Linux distro, it exits immediately with an error:

- `unsupported operating system: only macOS, Linux, and Windows are supported (detected <os>)`
- `unsupported linux distro: Linux support is limited to Ubuntu/Debian, Arch, Fedora/RHEL family, and Termux (detected <distro>)`
