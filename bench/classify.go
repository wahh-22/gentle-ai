// annotation that must survive a check against those same bytes. Rule 6 is a
// bare bool nobody can falsify from outside. More evidence wins.

// for them by what they assert about the operator's next action:
//
//   - dead_end says there is NO next action. The flow is over; the product owes
//     the reader nothing further because there is nothing further. It is the
//     worst outcome in this benchmark and it is still counted as one.
//   - by_design says there IS a next action, the product already stated it, and
//     it simply is not expressible as a `gentle-ai` command — because it needs
//     a value only the operator has, because it is an act in the world, or
//     because it is a human decision the whole gate exists to require.
//

// anything to do next?". A step declaring both is contradicting itself, and
// validateCorpus rejects that combination before any journey runs, which is why
