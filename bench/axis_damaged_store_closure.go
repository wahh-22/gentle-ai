// Wave 6 closure disposition journeys (Slice S5, ds09-ds12)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The ds06/ds08 journeys above (Wave 2) prove the cardinality-one leaf
// disposition plan black-box. Wave 6 relaxes admission to N>=1 closed-class
// closures with descendant-first ordering, an ordered N-node transaction,
// and forward-only resume (internal/reviewtransaction Slices S1-S3) and a
// negotiated `review status --next-transition` route (Slice S4). These four
// journeys are that relaxation's own exit evidence: ds09 proves a real
// multi-hop (N=3) closure derives and disposes end-to-end; ds10 proves the
// over-collection guard holds for everything NOT in the closure; ds11 proves
// a closure interrupted mid-transaction resumes forward-only through the
// real binary; ds12 proves the negotiated route this axis's ds06/ds08 never
// exercised (they always drove --plan-digest/--inventory-revision straight
// from `review repair --preflight`, never from
// `review status --next-transition`).
//
// The closure shape here is a LINEAR chain (seed -> child -> grandchild),
// not a branching tree: `review recover` refuses a second successor from
// the same predecessor ("recovery predecessor already has successor"), a
// real product constraint discovered while building this fixture — a
// lineage can have at most one direct successor through the CLI, so a
// closure with more than one descendant can only ever be a chain, never a
// fork. This still exercises the multi-hop BFS/DFS walk
// authorityDispositionClosure performs (internal/reviewtransaction Slice
// S1's TestAuthorityDispositionClosureMultiChainAssumption already proves
// that walk correct for exactly this report-edge shape) and the N=3 ordered
// transaction (Slice S2) — only the "branching" framing in the original
// task naming does not exist as a constructible product state.

// Every mint happens FIRST, while the whole graph is still valid:
// validateCompactRecoveryEdge runs at write time on `review recover` (file

// predecessor once the graph already holds even one invalid edge elsewhere
// — the seed cannot be damaged before its descendants are minted. Damaging
// the seed LAST necessarily changes the seed's own file bytes (and
// therefore its revision — see damageRecordedReason), which would otherwise
// strand the child's already-recorded predecessor_revision/authorization
// against a predecessor that has since moved; realignRecoveryAuthorization
// re-signs the child's own authorization (never its target_identity, actor,
// or reason — only what actually changed) against the seed's post-damage
// revision so the child's edge stays genuinely valid. Realigning the child
// itself changes the CHILD's own revision, so the grandchild needs the same
// treatment, cascading one hop further — exactly the same cascade
// damagedEdgePair's own comment describes, except kept CONSISTENT at each
// step instead of deliberately left stale. This achieves, through the CLI's
// own write-time validation, the same end state

// review-state.json directly" convention) rather than genuinely interrupting
// a live process, and covered only one of the six ordered positions
// internal/reviewtransaction's own TestAuthorityDispositionResumeCrashPositionMatrix
// proves in-process. sdd-verify's cycle-2 WARNING named this as the wave's
// last open gap: the spec's "interrupt at each ordered position" is
// load-bearing at the journey layer specifically because this wave's S5
// found a real public-entrypoint defect Go-level tests structurally could
// not see (RepairAuthorityDisposition's own re-derivation, not
// executeAuthorityDisposition's internal resume logic) — so a journey that
// only authors state, or only covers one position, cannot rule out the same
// class of gap recurring at a position it never reaches.
//
// This is resolved by reusing the EXACT deterministic phase-hook

// closure member) pair, each proving: the crash-inducing attempt genuinely
// refuses through the real binary; the resumed attempt then converges with
// no double move; and every closure member's quarantined residue bytes are
