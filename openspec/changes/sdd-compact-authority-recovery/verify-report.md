> **Superseded historical review-routing claim:** This report's statements that review authority blocks verification or archive, including `resolve-review`, are retained only as historical evidence. The current #3417 policy is apply → independent verify → optional review offer → archive; review state is informational and cannot block verification, archive, or delivery.

## Verification Report

**Change**: `sdd-compact-authority-recovery`
**Issue**: [#1179](https://github.com/Gentleman-Programming/gentle-ai/issues/1179)
**Version**: N/A
**Mode**: Strict TDD
**Approved review authority**: `review-a690f3e160da0732`
**Final verdict**: **PASS WITH WARNINGS**

### Preflight and Routing Safety

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Persistence selection | ✅ | Auto-detected OpenSpec at `openspec/changes/sdd-compact-authority-recovery` |
| Delivery strategy | ✅ | Single PR with explicit `size:exception`; effective maintainer ceiling is 950 authored lines |
| Review authority | ✅ | Receipt `review-a690f3e160da0732` is approved; live `review validate --gate post-apply` returned `allow` |
| Historical failed report classification | ✅ | The prior report was substantive, not authority-only: it had two substantive CRITICAL findings, command exits `0/0`, and none of the five authority-only recovery fields |
| Automatic retry routing | ✅ Fail-closed | Native `sdd-status` kept verify/archive blocked and recommended `resolve-review`; a substantive report cannot enter the authority-only changed-revision bypass |
| Independent rerun authorization | ✅ | This report is a fresh explicit post-remediation verification against the newly approved authority; it replaces the failed result rather than reclassifying its history |
| Post-report routing | ✅ Fail-closed | Native status accepts this report as `verify: all_done` but keeps archive blocked because multiple terminal native receipts are discoverable without a change-local receipt mirror |

The prior failed report was preserved until this independent rerun. Its safe blocked routing was validated before replacement.

### Spec Compliance Matrix

| Requirement | Scenario | Runtime evidence | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Compact authority pre-verification recovery | Exactly one valid authority | `TestResolveBridgesExactlyOnePathBoundCompactAuthorityToVerifyOnly` | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| Compact authority pre-verification recovery | Multi-lineage authority recovery | `TestResolveRecoversWithObservedStaleAndNewLiveCompactLineages`; matching `scope-changed` case in `TestObservedRevisionSkipsOnlyScopeChangedPredecessor` | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| Compact authority pre-verification recovery | Invalid or ambiguous authority | Discovery, path binding, ambiguity, receipt mismatch, non-allow, and matching `invalidated`/`escalated` deny cases all pass | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| Compact authority pre-verification recovery | Ineligible failed report | `TestAuthorityOnlyFailedReportRequiresStructuredFailClosedEvidence`, `TestResolveRecoversOnlyAuthorityMissingHistoricalVerification`, and live native status against the prior substantive report | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| Compact authority pre-verification recovery | Authority-only verification envelope | `TestSDDVerifyAuthorityPreflightDenialEnvelopeContract` plus strict parser cases for `125/125` and exact empty-output hashes | ✅ COMPLIANT |

**Compliance summary**: 5/5 scenarios and 1/1 requirement compliant.

### Correctness (Static Evidence)

| Requirement area | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Git common-dir compact discovery | ✅ Implemented | Compact stores are discovered only after apply when no local transaction mirror exists. |
| Active-change path binding | ✅ Implemented | Immutable paths must be canonical, equal, and exclusively bound to the active OpenSpec change. |
| Receipt/revision/live-target binding | ✅ Implemented | Approved state, receipt equality, live post-apply evaluation, and state/receipt stability recheck are enforced. |
| Narrow predecessor exception | ✅ Implemented | `skipsObservedStalePredecessor` requires exact observed revision and `GateScopeChanged`; matching `invalidated`, `escalated`, or `allow` and mismatched revisions return false. |
| Strict authority-only report parsing | ✅ Implemented | Exact fields, `125/125`, empty-output hashes, blocker counts, concrete commands, and changed authority are required. |
| Verify-only routing and archive protection | ✅ Implemented | Eligible authority makes only verify ready; no mirror is synthesized and archive remains blocked until fresh passing evidence exists. |

### Coherence (Design)

| Decision | Followed? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Exact active-change canonical binding | ✅ Yes | Implemented and tested. |
| Receipt equality plus live post-apply gate | ✅ Yes | Approved receipt returned live `allow`. |
| Verify-only routing with no mirror writes | ✅ Yes | Runtime fixture checks both routing and absent mirror. |
| Strict authority-only envelope | ✅ Yes | Parser and embedded assets agree on the five recovery fields. |
| Skip only the report-observed stale denied revision | ✅ Yes | The exception is limited to exact `scope-changed`; invalidated and escalated are denied. |

### TDD Compliance

| Check | Result | Details |
|---|---|---|
| TDD Evidence reported | ✅ | Per-task `TDD Cycle Evidence` table is present in `apply-progress.md`. |
| All tasks have tests | ✅ | 8/8 task rows map to existing test files. |
| RED confirmed | ✅ | Test files exist; the remediation row records the focused undefined-helper RED build failure before production implementation. |
| GREEN confirmed | ✅ | Focused behavior and full-suite executions pass now. |
| Triangulation adequate | ✅ | Positive recovery and distinct absent, malformed, command-failed, foreign, traversal, ambiguous, receipt-mismatch, scope-changed, invalidated, escalated, allow, and revision-mismatch variants pass. |
| Safety net for modified files | ✅ | Every task row records the passing pre-remediation focused baseline. |

**TDD compliance**: 6/6 checks passed; 8/8 task rows contain cycle evidence.

### Test Layer Distribution

| Layer | Tests | Files | Tools |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Unit | 19 leaf cases | 2 | Go `testing` |
| Integration | 9 leaf cases | 1 | Go `testing`, temporary Git repositories, compact stores, real Git commands |
| E2E | 0 | 0 | Not required; the specified runtime boundary is the temporary Git-store harness |
| **Total** | **28 leaf cases** | **2** | |

### Changed File Coverage

| File | Statement coverage | Rating |
|---|---:|---|
| `internal/sddstatus/review_gate.go` | 81.6% | ⚠️ Acceptable |
| `internal/sddstatus/status.go` | 73.1% | ⚠️ Low |
| Embedded Markdown assets | Contract-tested | ➖ N/A |

Coverage is informational. The changed high-risk predicates and routing functions have direct runtime coverage: `skipsObservedStalePredecessor` 100%, `authorityOnlyFailedReport` 100%, `authorityChangedSinceReport` 100%, and `applyPreVerifyCompactBridgeRouting` 100%.

### Assertion Quality

**Assertion quality**: ✅ All changed assertions execute production behavior and verify values, routing, side effects, or exact embedded contracts. No tautologies, orphan empty checks, ghost loops, smoke-only assertions, or mock-heavy files were found.

### Quality Metrics

**Linter**: ➖ No dedicated linter configured
**Type checker / vet**: ✅ No errors
**Formatter**: ✅ No changed Go files reported
**Diff hygiene**: ✅ No tracked or OpenSpec artifact whitespace findings before this report rewrite

### Issues Found

**CRITICAL**: None.

**WARNING**

1. `internal/sddstatus/status.go` has 73.1% statement coverage. This is informational under Strict TDD; all changed authority-recovery decision points are directly covered.
2. Archive remains intentionally blocked: native status reports multiple terminal receipts and requires explicit receipt reconciliation. Verification passed, but this report does not authorize archive by itself.

**SUGGESTION**: None.

### Verdict

**PASS WITH WARNINGS**

The remediation closes both prior CRITICAL findings. All requirements, scenarios, and tasks are satisfied; focused and full runtime checks pass; invalidated and escalated observed predecessors remain denied; and only the exact scope-changed predecessor can be skipped. Archive may be considered only through the normal post-verification receipt/evidence flow.
