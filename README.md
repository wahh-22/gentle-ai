> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Receipt-Driven Development (RDD) is the supported stable path.** `v2.2.0` was the historical release where that path became supported after RDD began in `v1.47.0`: small work stays direct, broader implementation is delegated, SDD stays optional, and every route converges on structural proof, bounded review, an exact receipt, and delivery authorization.
>
> The current stable release is [`v2.3.0`](https://github.com/Gentleman-Programming/gentle-ai/releases/tag/v2.3.0). `@latest` is the stable channel:
>
> ```bash
> go install github.com/gentleman-programming/gentle-ai/v2/cmd/gentle-ai@latest
> ```
>
> To opt into the current prerelease, [`v2.4.0-rc.1`](https://github.com/Gentleman-Programming/gentle-ai/releases/tag/v2.4.0-rc.1), install its exact tag:
>
> ```bash
> go install github.com/gentleman-programming/gentle-ai/v2/cmd/gentle-ai@v2.4.0-rc.1
> ```
>
> Use `@main` only for unreleased development changes. See the [full RDD version policy](docs/quickstart.md#version-policy).

> Note the `/v2` suffix: Go requires it for major version 2 and above. Releases before `v2.0.0` use the unsuffixed import path.

## What It Does

Gentle-AI is NOT an AI agent installer. It adapts the agent runtime(s) already on your machine; it never installs one for you. If a selected agent isn't detected, Gentle-AI refuses and names the exact command you'd run yourself instead. It is an **ecosystem configurator** that equips the AI coding agent(s) you already use with persistent memory, Spec-Driven Development (SDD), curated skills, MCP servers, model routing, a teaching-oriented persona, and bounded native review.

**Before**: "I installed Claude Code / OpenCode / Cursor, but it's just a chatbot that writes code."

**After**: Your agent now has memory, skills, workflow, MCP tools, and a persona that actually teaches you.

### Supported Agent Integrations

> **Note**: This project supersedes [Agent Teams Lite](https://github.com/Gentleman-Programming/agent-teams-lite) (now archived). Everything ATL provided is included here with better installation, automatic updates, and persistent memory.

### Organic Routing and Review Boundaries

Every configured agent receives the same outcome-first routing, even when the optional SDD component is not selected. Ask for the outcome; the agent uses exactly one implementation route and reviews the candidate only after implementation.

| Situation | Expected behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Understanding needs 1-3 files, or one mechanical file change is already understood | Keep the bounded action direct and inline. |
| Understanding needs 4+ files, reading prepares a write, broad research is needed, or a writer changes 2+ non-trivial files | Delegate the narrow exploration or one focused writer without creating SDD state. |
| Durable proposal, spec, design, and task artifacts would materially reduce substantial ambiguity | Offer optional SDD; select it only after an explicit request or an accepted proposal. |
| A candidate is ready for review | Freeze the exact bytes and derive review effort from evidence, never size alone. Interactive starts ask once per clone before reviewer work; non-interactive tier-1/tier-2 starts proceed without prompting and report how to disable review mode. |
| Commit, push, PR, or release | Validate the same content-bound receipt at the applicable delivery gate; never silently reopen review or create another budget. |
| Scope changes or an operation is interrupted | Use provider-owned status, recovery, and reconciliation; do not infer authority or replay safety from narration. |

Implementation routing does not decide review strength, and per-action test, build, install, or review workers do not change the selected route. Native commands own repository identity, candidate scope, lifecycle transitions, receipts, and safe continuations. See [Organic Implementation Routing](docs/trigger-rules.md), the [Organic RDD architecture](docs/architecture/organic-rdd.md), and the [review authority threat model](docs/review-authority-threat-model.md).

## Quick Start

### Install (recommended)

> [!NOTE]
> `gentle-ai install` requires Node.js 18+ and npm on every platform (it warns if either is missing). See [Prerequisites](docs/quickstart.md#prerequisites) for your distro's install hint.

**macOS / Linux**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gentleman-Programming/gentle-ai/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**

```powershell
go install github.com/gentleman-programming/gentle-ai/v2/cmd/gentle-ai@latest
```

> [!WARNING]
> Windows source builds and CI/runtime tests remain supported, but official Windows binary distribution and Scoop are temporarily unavailable. Windows installation and upgrades require Go 1.25.10+ and fail closed to source-install guidance; they never download an unsigned Gentle AI executable or execute a remote update script.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After replacing or upgrading the `gentle-ai` binary, run `gentle-ai sync` to refresh its managed assets. See the [sync and upgrade reference](docs/usage.md#sync).

### Configure project context

Once your agents are configured, open your AI agent in a project and run these two commands to register the project context:

| Command                            | What it does                                                                | When to re-run                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/sdd-init`                        | Detects stack, testing capabilities, activates Strict TDD Mode if available | When your project adds/removes test frameworks, or first time in a new project |
| `gentle-ai skill-registry refresh` | Scans installed skills and project conventions, builds the registry         | After installing/removing skills, or first time in a new project               |

These are **not required** for basic usage. The SDD orchestrator runs `/sdd-init` automatically if it detects no context. Startup hooks normally keep the skill registry fresh for agents that support hooks, including Codex, Claude Code, OpenCode, and Pi through `gentle-pi`. If you start Pi with `pi -ns`, startup skill loading/hooks are skipped, so run the registry refresh manually when you need updated project rules.

Run `gentle-ai doctor` at any time for a read-only health check of your ecosystem (tool binaries, `state.json`, Engram reachability, disk space).

<details>
<summary><strong>Alternative install and scope options</strong></summary>

**Homebrew (macOS / Linux)**

```bash
brew tap Gentleman-Programming/homebrew-tap
brew trust --formula gentleman-programming/tap/gentle-ai  # one-time, for Homebrew tap trust
brew install gentle-ai
```

**Go install: stable channel (any platform with Go 1.25.10+)**

```bash
go install github.com/gentleman-programming/gentle-ai/v2/cmd/gentle-ai@latest
```

Note the `/v2` in the module path: Go requires it for major version 2 and
above. Releases before `v2.0.0` use the unsuffixed path.

**Scoop (Windows)** — temporarily unavailable while official Windows binary distribution is held for public-trust Authenticode signing. Use the Windows `go install` command above.

By default, `gentle-ai install` writes agent-scoped files to each selected agent's global config directory. To keep the Gentleman stack isolated to one project, run:

```bash
gentle-ai install --scope=workspace
```

Workspace scope applies to selected agents for agent-scoped files such as system prompts, skills, SDD agents, and persona files. Global-only integrations remain global by design.

**Unreleased development channel (`main`)** — use only to test changes that are not part of a release. The managed beta installer tracks `main`; it requires Go 1.25.10+:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gentleman-Programming/gentle-ai/main/scripts/install.sh | bash -s -- --channel beta

# Windows (PowerShell)
$env:GENTLE_AI_CHANNEL="beta"; go install github.com/gentleman-programming/gentle-ai/v2/cmd/gentle-ai@main
```

### RDD version policy

Receipt-Driven Development (RDD) started in `gentle-ai` `v1.47.0` on 2026-07-10, with the first bounded native review transactions, and became the supported stable path in `v2.2.0`. Those are historical milestones; the negotiated public review contract was published in `v2.1.6`.

The current stable release is [`v2.3.0`](https://github.com/Gentleman-Programming/gentle-ai/releases/tag/v2.3.0). The current prerelease is [`v2.4.0-rc.1`](https://github.com/Gentleman-Programming/gentle-ai/releases/tag/v2.4.0-rc.1). `main` is unreleased development.

**Stable channel (`@latest`, currently `v2.3.0`)**

```bash
go install github.com/gentleman-programming/gentle-ai/v2/cmd/gentle-ai@latest
gentle-ai version
```

**Prerelease channel (`v2.4.0-rc.1`)**

```bash
go install github.com/gentleman-programming/gentle-ai/v2/cmd/gentle-ai@v2.4.0-rc.1
gentle-ai version
```

**Unreleased development (`main`)**

```bash
go install github.com/gentleman-programming/gentle-ai/v2/cmd/gentle-ai@main
gentle-ai version
```

The managed installer tracks the channel's latest version and does not accept an arbitrary release pin. Use `go install` when reproducibility requires an exact version.

## Core Workflow

1. **Install and configure.** Run the installer, select the agents and components you want, then open your agent in a project.
2. **Use the smallest implementation route.** Keep bounded work direct, delegate actions that need fresh context, and use SDD only after an explicit request or an accepted proposal. SDD artifacts can live in **Engram** for cross-session memory, **OpenSpec** for versioned files, or **hybrid** for both.
3. **Build with discipline.** `/sdd-init` detects project testing capabilities; when Strict TDD is active, SDD apply works test-first. SDD verify audits RED/GREEN evidence and runs verification. Agents that support delegation use focused subagents instead of one growing conversation.
4. **Review one candidate.** After implementation, bounded native review freezes the candidate and issues one content-bound receipt. Commit, push, and PR validate that same receipt. Releases validate native authority and its receipt, unless the protected-main fast path has the exact tag/current `origin/main` SHA, exact-SHA successful CI, a remote-head recheck, and no fresh risk.

> **Trust what the system can derive, not agent narration.** [Chapter 21 — Verifiable Trust](https://the-amazing-gentleman-programming-book.vercel.app/en/book/Chapter21_Verifiable-Trust) explains the mental model: agents assess the candidate; native authority and delivery gates independently derive what may be trusted.

5. **Upgrade, then sync.** Refresh the binary and the managed agent assets together:

   ```bash
   gentle-ai upgrade
   gentle-ai sync
   ```

### The flow at a glance

Both implementation routes converge on RDD: a bounded native review freezes the candidate and issues the one receipt that every delivery gate validates — review is never reopened for unchanged content.

**Organic route (no SDD)** — the agent picks the smallest useful route and RDD enters at the end, over the frozen candidate:

**SDD route** — durable planning artifacts first, then apply, with RDD reviewing the candidate before verify and archive requiring the receipt:

    style O fill:#2D4F67,color:#fff
    style P fill:#B8860B,color:#fff
    style T fill:#2D4F67,color:#fff
```

Size, file count, or perceived risk never select SDD on their own — only an explicit request or an accepted proposal does. Either way, one candidate gets one review, one possible correction, and one receipt.

### Control receipt-driven development

Review mode is user-owned and available independently of the review lifecycle:

```bash
gentle-ai review mode status --cwd .
gentle-ai review mode disable --cwd .
gentle-ai review mode enable --cwd .
```

`status` is read-only. Any global or clone-local disabled source wins; a clone can opt out with `--scope clone` but cannot force review on. Re-enabling applies only to future candidates, while declining a one-candidate review prompt does not change the mode. When review is disabled, existing exact governing receipts remain authoritative; otherwise native review gates report `disabled/unmanaged` and defer delivery to ordinary repository policy without fabricating approval.

Historical note: `v2.2.2` introduced the native delivery-gate `disabled/unmanaged` disposition. Current SDD status does not use that disposition: with review disabled, it skips review authority, emits no `reviewGate`, and pre-verify continues without routing to a review that cannot start. Archive proceeds under ordinary repository policy when `reviewGate` is absent; a present `reviewGate.result: allow` is required only for discovered review activity. This differs from native delivery gates, which report `disabled/unmanaged` when review is disabled.

### Release verification

Official macOS and Linux release archives require an authenticated `checksums.txt`. The built-in upgrader verifies its Minisign signature, its exact `Gentleman-Programming/gentle-ai` + release-tag binding, and the selected archive checksum **before** replacing the installed binary. Release archives are capped at **128 MiB**, including chunked or unknown-length responses. Missing, oversized, malformed, untrusted, or placeholder key material fails closed without changing the installed binary.

To verify a release manually, obtain the production public-key payload and fingerprint from a maintainer-controlled channel, then download `checksums.txt` and `checksums.txt.minisig` from the same release:

```bash
minisign -VQm checksums.txt -x checksums.txt.minisig -P "$GENTLE_AI_MINISIGN_PUBLIC_KEY"
# Expected output: repo=Gentleman-Programming/gentle-ai;tag=vX.Y.Z
sha256sum --check --strict --ignore-missing checksums.txt
```

Do not bootstrap trust from a public key downloaded only beside the artifacts it verifies. See [Release signing and key rotation](docs/release-signing.md) for the first-signed-release procedure, exact CI injection points, and rotation runbook.

Windows archives and Scoop publication remain omitted until publicly trusted RSA Authenticode signing is provisioned (prefer managed OIDC with Azure Artifact Signing), both amd64 and arm64 executables are signed before archive and checksum generation, and release verification fails if either executable is unsigned.

### Review a focused staged candidate

For a monorepo or shared worktree, explicitly review exactly what is in the Git index:

```bash
git add apps/my-service
git diff --cached
gentle-ai review start --projection staged
```

The staged projection freezes the **complete existing index**, including all previously staged paths. It starts review but does not itself issue an approved receipt; unstaged and untracked worktree content is excluded. The default `workspace` projection remains the complete workspace review, and an existing authority is never auto-converted between projections. See the [review authority threat model](docs/review-authority-threat-model.md) for delivery and base-ref details.

### Backups

Every install, sync, and upgrade automatically snapshots your config files. Backups are **compressed** (tar.gz), **deduplicated** (identical configs are not re-backed up), and **auto-pruned** (keeps the 5 most recent). Pin important backups via the TUI (`p` key) to protect them from pruning.

See [Backup & Rollback Guide](docs/rollback.md) for details.

## Key Features You Should Know About

### OpenCode SDD Profiles

Assign different AI models to different SDD phases -- a powerful model for design, a fast one for implementation, a cheap one for exploration. OpenCode uses **`gentle-orchestrator`** as the base SDD conductor, and generated named profiles still appear as `sdd-orchestrator-{name}` entries.

```bash
# Via CLI
gentle-ai sync --profile cheap:openrouter/qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b:free
gentle-ai sync --profile-phase cheap:sdd-design:anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514

# Or via TUI: gentle-ai → "OpenCode SDD Profiles" → Create
```

After creating a profile, open OpenCode and press **Tab** to switch between `gentle-orchestrator` (default) and your custom profiles.

| What you need         | Use this                                                        |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Default SDD conductor | `gentle-orchestrator`                                           |
| Legacy configs        | `sdd-orchestrator` is migrated to `gentle-orchestrator` on sync |
| Named model profiles  | `sdd-orchestrator-cheap`, `sdd-orchestrator-premium`, etc.      |

**Full guide**: [OpenCode SDD Profiles](docs/opencode-profiles.md)

### Engram (Persistent Memory)

Your AI agent automatically remembers decisions, bugs, and context across sessions. You don't need to do anything -- but when you do:

```bash
engram projects list          # See all projects with memory counts
engram projects consolidate   # Fix name drift ("my-app" vs "My-App")
engram search "auth bug"      # Find a past decision from the terminal
engram tui                    # Visual memory browser
```

## Community Highlights

This project gets better when the community builds on top of it.

### Community Integrations

- [sub-agent-statusline](https://github.com/Joaquinvesapa/sub-agent-statusline) — optional OpenCode TUI plugin that shows sub-agent activity, status, elapsed time, and token/context usage when OpenCode exposes it.
- [sdd-engram-plugin](https://github.com/j0k3r-dev-rgl/sdd-engram-plugin) — optional OpenCode TUI plugin to manage SDD profiles and browse Engram memories directly from OpenCode, with runtime profile activation and no restart required.

When you select OpenCode in the installer, Gentle-AI asks whether to register each community plugin and offers a browser shortcut to review the repository first. Gentle-AI only ensures `~/.config/opencode/tui.json` exists and adds the plugin package names to its `plugin` array; OpenCode installs/loads those packages the next time it starts. Once OpenCode has materialized a plugin under `~/.config/opencode/node_modules/`, `gentle-ai update` can compare its local `package.json` version with the plugin's GitHub releases.

## Next Steps

- **Just installed?** Read [Intended Usage](docs/intended-usage.md) for the mental model, then run `gentle-ai doctor` if anything looks wrong.
- **Starting work?** Read [Organic Implementation Routing](docs/trigger-rules.md) to understand direct, delegated, and optional SDD behavior.
- **Reviewing a focused change?** Start with the [Organic RDD architecture](docs/architecture/organic-rdd.md) and [review authority threat model](docs/review-authority-threat-model.md).
- **Maintaining Gentle AI?** Use the [Codebase Guide](docs/CODEBASE-GUIDE.md) to find package ownership and review boundaries.
- **Using Pi?** Read [Pi Agent](docs/pi.md) for the `gentle-pi` harness, Pi commands, persona, and model assignments.
- **Ready to contribute?** Start at the [Community Roadmap](docs/community-roadmap.md) — everything labelled [`up-for-grabs`](https://github.com/Gentleman-Programming/gentle-ai/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aup-for-grabs) is scoped, approved and unclaimed. Then read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
