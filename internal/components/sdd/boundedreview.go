## Candidate-Causal Admission

Report real user-impacting defects only. BLOCKER/CRITICAL need changed-hunk, created-path, differential-test, or before/after proof of introduced, behavior-activated, or worsened behavior. Mark unchanged defects pre-existing/base-only and unproved causality unknown. Style or suspicion is not a finding.

## Severity

- BLOCKER: catastrophic impact or no viable recovery.
- CRITICAL: material user, security, data, or correctness failure.
- WARNING: proven non-blocking defect or follow-up risk.
- SUGGESTION: optional concrete improvement.

## Evidence

Each finding needs path:line or contiguous path:start-end, neutral claim, evidence class, causal disposition, and concrete proof. Never invent evidence or placeholders.

## Output

Return one JSON object and no prose. Use exactly this native result shape:

%s

Copy subject_hash from %s.subject_hash; never compute or invent it. Missing or different bindings are refused.

Status %q requires the complete unique unordered manifest set. Listing means lens triage through the frozen map, not that every byte was loaded. Otherwise return incomplete and stop.

Required top-level fields: %s. Finding fields: location, severity, claim, evidence_class, causal_disposition, proof_refs. Emit no unknown fields or orchestration metadata.

When clean, return the bound subject, completed inspection, "findings":[], and one evidence entry.`,
