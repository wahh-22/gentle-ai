// execution contract bound to the runtime identity where the runtime receives

// A runtime outside model.SupportsReceiptDrivenDevelopment receives ODD only:
// the provider defect handoff (which exists to settle the review consent
// envelope) and the review lifecycle are removed, and the verification and
// checking contracts take their ODD-only form. A render that would still carry
// review wording fails closed.

// Pi is rejected: its prompt is owned by the Gentle Shell package.

// It renders with the package-level review contract source; production callers
// use RenderOrchestratorWithSource or RoutingOptions.ReviewContract instead.
