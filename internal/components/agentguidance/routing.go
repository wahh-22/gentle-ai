High, or an unavailable or failed assessment: the commit itself is the candidate; run the native preflight STATUS with `--base-ref <last reviewed boundary> --committed-only` right away. Medium: defer; the candidate is the PR slice, the commits accumulated since the last reviewed boundary, bounded by the delivery budget of about 400 authored changed lines; at slice close, when the budget is reached or the feature ends, run the preflight STATUS with `--base-ref <last reviewed boundary> --committed-only`.

When the forecast or the running count exceeds about 400 authored changed lines, apply the chosen strategy before the next commit: `ask-on-risk` asks once for the chain strategy, `stacked-to-main` or `feature-branch-chain`; `auto-chain` asks only for a missing chain strategy and slices automatically. Cache both choices, and record slice boundaries, which commits each pull request holds, in the feature document.
