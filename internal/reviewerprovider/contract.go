// targetedValidatorPromptInstruction is the targeted validator's complete
// briefing. Unlike a reviewing lens, this role may hold live tools on some
// runtimes, so the briefing must say which immutable-inspection command exists
// and where each of its arguments comes from. Withholding that recipe while
// inviting an "I could not inspect it" answer is what produced #3380: one
// runtime spent the lineage's single correction attempt on a non-observation
// and another stranded its lineage with no verdict at all.
//
// It also tells the validator to report an unreachable candidate through the
// typed check.inspection field, never through evidence wording (issue #4266):
// before this field existed, admission keyword-scanned each check's evidence
// for phrases like "could not be inspected", so a validator that faithfully
// quoted the candidate's own strings, or that described a feature about
// unreadable candidates, was misjudged as unable to read the candidate on
// every retry.

	"for every path in `validation_request.correction_paths`. It is authoritative corrected-candidate content read " +
	"from the immutable trees, not a summary of them, so a verdict reached from it is a verified verdict. " +
	"When you can run commands, read those same immutable trees yourself with " +

	"and never reach the repository through any other command.\n\n" +

	"It is admissible only after the supplied evidence, and that command where you can run it, have both failed to " +
	"answer. Never record an inconclusive inspection as a failed check: a failed check spends the correction budget " +
	"on something you did not observe.\n\n" +
	"Reporting an unreachable candidate: use each check's inspection field, never evidence wording. When a check's " +
	"verdict came from actually reading the frozen trees, omit inspection entirely -- that is the default. When it " +
	"did not, and the check therefore carries no verdict, set that check's inspection.status to \"unavailable\" and " +
	"inspection.reason to why the frozen trees could not be read. Only this typed field marks a check inconclusive: " +
	"quoting the candidate's own text, including a fixture string or a feature description that itself talks about " +
	"unreadable candidates, is ordinary evidence and never changes the verdict on its own.\n\n" +
	"Return exactly one JSON object with no prose. " +
	"Validate your result against the supplied output schema. " +
	"Echo targeted_validation_request_hash and correction_target_identity from the input. " +
	"Include original_criteria and correction_regression, each with a boolean passed and non-empty evidence. " +
	"Set `original_criteria.passed` to true only when every original criterion is met in the corrected candidate; set it to false when any original criterion remains unmet. " +
	"Set `correction_regression.passed` to true only when the correction caused no regression; set it to false when you observe a regression. " +
	"When `correction_regression.passed` is false, populate `correction_regression.regressions` with one entry per observed regression (id, location, claim, proof_refs) before writing its evidence prose; when it is true, omit `regressions` or use []. " +
