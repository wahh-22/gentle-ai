// Receipt-driven review acts AFTER implementation and verification, on the
// finished result. That is not an aspiration bolted on here: this package
// already implements it twice.
//
//   applyReviewOfferRouting (status.go) fires in exactly one window — verify
//   has passed and the kill switch is on — and with the switch off it "returns
//   before doing anything at all [...] which is what makes the absence
//   structural".
//
//   resolveNextRecommended (status.go) never routes to review before verify.
//   `resolve-review` appears only once apply is done, a verify report exists,
//   and verification did not pass.
//
// A third place disagreed with both: Finish refused to close a PASSING
// IMPLEMENTATION attempt whenever a review binding covered the pre-attempt
// bytes. That is review acting during implementation, before any verification
// has run, and it is what #1993 hit — the corrected candidate passed every
// gate the maintainer authorized, and the settle refused because the binding
// covered the target from before the correction.
//
// Removing it takes nothing away from delivery. The delivery gates
// (post-apply, pre-commit, pre-push, pre-pr, release) re-derive their verdict
// from the candidate actually being delivered, so an unreviewed candidate is
// still refused there — after SDD finishes, which is the whole point.
