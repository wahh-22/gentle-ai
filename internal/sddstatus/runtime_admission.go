// runtimeReadiness already did this for the LEDGER half, and #2471's root 13
// counted that as the fix for "two authorities disagree". The reports kept
// arriving because the REPOSITORY half lived inline in Begin's mutation
// closure, where no read-only surface could reach it. Status asked
// runtimeReadiness, got "nothing blocks", and printed next_action: "begin"
// while acquire, running the very same request through this code a moment
// later, blocked on a candidate that could not be captured or one that had
// drifted out from under the objective (#2114, reported three times).
//
// Extracting it is what makes the disagreement structurally impossible rather
// than merely fixed for today's causes: Begin cannot grow a new
// repository-side precondition without every read-only surface inheriting it,
// because there is only one place to put it.
