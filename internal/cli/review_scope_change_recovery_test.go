// TestPrePushScopeChangeNamedRecoveryReachesAllow is the guard the existing
// suite was missing. Every earlier test asserted only that a scope-changed
// denial EMITTED a recovery continuation; none of them ever executed the
// recovery it named. Both pre-push scope-changed classes shipped a message
// that dead-ended: the receipt-binding class named a bare `review.recover`
// that freezes an empty current-changes successor (base_tree ==
// candidate_tree) and re-trips the same one-commit delivery rule, and the
// delivery-shape class named nothing at all.
//
// This test drives the real facade entry points the CLI dispatches to
// (RunReviewFacadeValidate, RunReviewRecover, RunReviewFacadeFinalize) over a
// real Git repository with a real bare publication remote. It reads the
// recovery out of the frozen diagnostics the denial itself carries -- never a
// recovery the test knows independently -- runs exactly that recovery, and
// requires the same gate to then return allow. A future scope-changed class
// whose named recovery dead-ends fails here.
