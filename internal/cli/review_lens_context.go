Scope. The %s sections below are the complete and only view of this candidate: all %d changed paths are present in full, in the canonical manifest order carried by %s. Do not read the working tree, the index, HEAD, or any other file, and do not run any command. Nothing outside these sections is part of this candidate, and anything you cannot see here is not evidence.

Causality. Report only what this candidate caused. Give every BLOCKER or CRITICAL finding an evidence_class and a causal_disposition, and mark what the base already contained as pre-existing or base-only rather than as a blocker.

Return. Emit exactly one JSON object and nothing else: no prose before or after it, no markdown fence, no task envelope. It must validate against the schema in %s. Set subject_hash to exactly %s. Set inspection.status to "completed" and inspection.paths to the complete unique unordered set of every manifest path. Each finding location is one path:line or path:start-end inclusive span. findings and evidence must both be present, and evidence must be non-empty.

Citations. Every finding location, and every path cited inside an evidence string or a proof_refs entry, must be a repository-relative path exactly as it appears in the changed-path manifest, optionally with :line or :start-end. Never cite absolute paths, bare file basenames without their directory, or non-path colon-number shapes such as host:port. Any token shaped like path:line is validated against the frozen repository, and one unknown path rejects the entire result. A finding whose causal_disposition is introduced, behavior-activated, or worsened must anchor its location entirely within lines this candidate changed: every line of a path:start-end span is validated as candidate-changed, one unchanged context line in the span rejects the entire result, and observations about unchanged code belong under pre-existing or base-only instead. When the candidate's own content contains a path-shaped literal that is not a real repository path (for example a traversal or fixture token inside a test), never reproduce that token in evidence or proof_refs: describe it in words and cite the manifest file and line that contain it.

Honesty. If you could not inspect the candidate, say so in evidence and do not return a clean result: an access failure is not a completed inspection, and reporting one as clean is the single outcome this review cannot recover from.`,
