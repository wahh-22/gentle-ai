// is the only other check that runs earlier, for the narrower immutable-
// receipt-transport property — this gate is the broader "can this runtime
// participate in review at all" precondition).

// An absent agent identity (the manual/non-agent compatibility path) is not
// gated at all: there is no adapter here to admit or deny, and direct
// `gentle-ai review start` remains compatibility-supported for explicit,
// manual, non-negotiated callers. A supplied identity that is unrecognised
// (capabilitymanifest.ForAgent returns ErrUnsupportedAgent), whose manifest
// does not advertise ContractReviewTransportV1 (Pi today — it declares only
// AutoInstall|SystemPrompt|MCP), or whose manifest fails its own canonical
// self-consistency Validate(), fails closed. The provider never probes a
// live runtime to decide this — it only ever re-checks the adapter's own
