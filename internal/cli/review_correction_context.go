// nothing has to be released; at the correction stage the opposite is true.
// Review authority exists, lens results are already admitted, so
// compactPristineReviewing is false and `review invalidate` refuses. The one
// exit that still accepts this state is `review abandon`
// (compactAbandonTerminalState refuses only approved, escalated and
// invalidated), and an operator who is handed the lens continuation here is
// told to do the one thing that cannot work.

// longer open -- is UNPROVEN, never over budget: reporting a stop from an
// inconclusive probe would strand a lineage whose validation was fine.
