// It never approves: `allowed` stays false, the result is not an allow, and no

// disabled switch defers delivery to ordinary repository policy — hooks, tests,
// and CI stay active and decide — so the command exits successfully and the
// typed result names `disabled/unmanaged` as what governs.
//
// Wave 5 (Gate Cutover) Slice 2, design decision 4: the caller consults the
// kill switch BEFORE any authority read, so this always reports the same
// fixed, generic reason and carries no discovery-kind detail (no Denial, no
// Context beyond the gate) — there is no discovery outcome to describe,
// because discovery never runs. This is an intentional behavior change from
// the pre-Slice-2 shape, which read authority first and then decorated the
// disabled report with what it found (a missing receipt, a stale one, an
// unresolvable target, competing authority, or a damaged inventory). That
// detail-visibility property is still true and still tested — while reviews
// are ON — in review_disabled_reach_test.go / review_disabled_delivery_test.go's
// "...WhileEnabled" siblings; it never applied while disabled, because while
// disabled receipt-driven development does not exist at all.
//
// The whole result is a fixed constant for a given gate, so replaying the
// same request always returns the same bytes, and a decoy/corrupted store
// contributes nothing to it — proven by
