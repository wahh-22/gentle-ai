import "regexp"

// ReviewerContextLevel names the mechanism that put the immutable candidate
// evidence in front of a reviewer. It is recorded so a receipt stays
// classifiable forever; it is never a gate input, and nothing in this product
// compares two levels or ranks them.
//
// The vocabulary is deliberately asymmetric, and that asymmetry is the whole
// forward-compatibility design:
//
//   - On INPUT it is closed. A caller may declare only a mechanism this
//     release actually implements, so an unrecognised declaration fails closed
//     instead of being recorded as fact.
//   - On READ it is open. A persisted level is validated for shape only, never
//     for membership, so a binary built today reads a receipt written by a
//     later release that records a mechanism this one has never heard of. Every
//     other closed vocabulary on the receipt (terminal_state, risk_level,
//     evidence_outcome) rejects its default case; this one must not, because a
//     receipt is issued once and read for the rest of its life.
//
// A level is never inferred. An absent level means "not recorded" — which is
// also what every receipt issued before this field existed carries — and never
// means "the weakest mechanism".
