// Wave 5 fix cycle 2, CRITICAL-A closure (verify-report #10186). Coordinator
// decision, recorded here and in design.md: a MINIMAL capture primitive, not
// a parallel v2-shaped admission pipeline. v2's ArtifactSubject/
// FrozenCandidateContext/reopen/journal machinery is legacy-era complexity
// already scheduled for Wave 7 deletion; rebuilding it for v3 would violate
// the wave's own simplification mandate. v3 needs exactly the minimum that
// makes ReviewCore.finalize's ErrFinalizeRequiresLensResults refusal
// satisfiable: persist captured lens results onto the v3 authority, bound
// to a provider-owned subject hash, through the existing Mutate/CAS path --
// no reopen, no separate artifact store, no findings/evidence ADMISSION
// pipeline (ArtifactSubject/FrozenCandidateContext/reopen stay v2-only).
//
// Fix cycle 3, CRITICAL-E closure (verify-report #10186 cycle 2, coordinator
// decision "option 2, the channel does what it appears to do"): the capture
// primitive DOES persist the reviewer's validated findings (not just
// SubjectHash) -- cycle 2's own capture-result already required and
// validated `findings`/`evidence` were present before this fix, so silently
// discarding them was a channel that looked like it carried findings and
// did not, a fail-open in an authorization system. Persisted findings feed
// the EXISTING AdmitCandidateCausalFindings at finalize (review_facade.go)
// -- the same admission decision function the --admission-findings channel
// already uses, reused rather than duplicated.

// SubjectHash gives, derived only from data already persisted on
// NewLineageAuthority, with no additional Git diff/manifest work (that
// richer FrozenCandidateContext derivation is v2-only).
//
// Deliberately excludes the authority's own revision (the CAS token): the
// revision changes on every Mutate, including the very capture this hash
// authorizes, so binding to it would relabel the "correct" subject hash on
// every resubmission -- the exact frozen-anchor lesson Phase 9 already
// applied to the archive re-verify gate (see review_reverify.go). LineageID
// and CandidateIdentity are frozen once at start and never mutate again for
// the authority's whole lifetime, so binding to them instead keeps this hash
// stable across every capture, including the idempotent-resubmission case.
