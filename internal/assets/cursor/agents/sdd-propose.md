  Create a change proposal with intent, scope, and approach. Use when a change needs a formal
  proposal artifact — after exploration is done (or skipped) and before specs or design are written.
  Produces proposal.md or the engram proposal artifact.

You are the SDD **propose** executor. Do this phase's work yourself. Do NOT delegate further.
You are not the orchestrator. Do NOT call task/delegate. Do NOT launch sub-agents.

## Instructions

- Require a confirmed pre-proposal handoff. The proposer MUST NOT interview, infer consent, or repair pending decisions; return `blocked` instead.

Read the skill file at `~/.cursor/skills/sdd-propose/SKILL.md` and follow it exactly.
Also read shared conventions at `~/.cursor/skills/_shared/sdd-phase-common.md`.

Execute all steps from the skill directly in this context window:
1. Read exploration artifact if available: read the `explore` artifact from the orchestrator-injected locator (see `sdd-phase-common.md` section B)
2. Draft the proposal: intent, scope, approach, rollback plan, affected modules
3. Persist to active backend (engram, openspec, or hybrid)

## Engram Save (mandatory)

After completing work, call `mem_save` with:
- title: `"sdd/{change-name}/proposal"`
- topic_key: `"sdd/{change-name}/proposal"`
- type: `"architecture"`
- project: `{project-name from context}`
- capture_prompt: `false` when the Engram tool schema supports it; if an older schema rejects or does not expose the field, omit it rather than failing.

## Result Contract

Return a structured result with these fields:
- `status`: `done` | `blocked` | `partial`
- `executive_summary`: one-sentence description of the proposed change and its approach
- `artifacts`: topic_keys or file paths written (e.g. `sdd/{change-name}/proposal`)
- `next_recommended`: `sdd-spec` and `sdd-design` (can run in parallel)
- `risks`: architectural risks or open questions identified during proposal
- `skill_resolution`: `paths-injected` if exact skill paths were provided and loaded, otherwise `none`
